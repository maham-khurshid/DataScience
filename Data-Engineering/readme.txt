## A company Called Gans is a startup developing an e-scooter-sharing system. It aspires to operate in the most populous cities all around the world. In each city, the company will have hundreds of e-scooters parked on the streets and allow users to rent them by the minute.
Some of Gansâ€™ most notorious and well-established competitors are TIER, probably the biggest player in the German-speaking countries, now expanding throughout other European countries, and Bird, a cool Californian company, already established in Europe.

The focus of most e-scooter companies is sustainable mobility: they are on the good side of the dichotomy between Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) versus Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEV). Most of their marketing efforts push the eco-friendly narrative: this is how they acquire new users and gain good press from citizens encountering scooters around the city.

However, Gans has seen that its operational success depends on something more mundane: having its scooters parked where users need them.

Ideally, scooters get rearranged organically by having certain users moving from point A to point B, and then an even number of users moving from point B to point A. However, some elements create asymmetries. Here are some of them:

* In hilly cities, users tend to use scooters to go uphill and then walk downhill.
* In the morning, there is a general movement from residential neighbourhoods towards the city centre.
* Whenever it starts raining, e-scooter usage decreases drastically.
* Young tourists travelling with cheap flights are a big potential group of users, but they need to find scooters downtown or nearby tourist landmarks.
