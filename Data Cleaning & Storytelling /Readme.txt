## This project is about Eniac —the e-commerce tech company, where I got a chance to work as a Data-Analyst with an insight Database of the company.
The company has high hopes put into the possibilities that come with Data Analysis, and they are especially hopeful that Data-Analyst's work can finally settle an ongoing debate: whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products.

***
* The Marketing Team Lead is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allow the company to grow.
* The main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the company’s recent quarterly results showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.


## Business Questions:

* How should products be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis?
* What is the distribution of product prices across different categories?
* How many products are being discounted?
* How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices?
* How do seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales?
* How could data collection be improved?


## Problem with Data:

Before getting too deep into the business questions, there is some bad news we need to share with me: the data appears to have some inconsistencies —it must have been corrupted.

The Database Administrator, Khader, blames the buggy pipeline that connects the online store with the database, while the Software Engineer, Lina, claims the issues have to do with wrong encodings and bad maintenance practices in our database. As Khader and Lina argue with one another and try to fix the data source, the company board does not have time to lose: they want my business insights.

In short, I will have to assess the data quality of the dataset and take on many data-cleaning tasks before I can even start to think about the business questions.

How mad should I be about that? A popular figure shared all the time in Data Science communities is that Data Analysts and Scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and preparing data. Ironically, there is no reliable data source for that number, but if I just talk with people in the field they will all tell me that it’s a major part of the job. There is little merit in applying advanced methods and fancy solutions to corrupted and unreliable datasets. The real value good Data Scientists can bring is usually to make dirty data usable and trustable —with the necessary disclaimers.
