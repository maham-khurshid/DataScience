###This project is about Eniac —the e-commerce tech company, where I get a chance to work as a Data-Analyst with insight Database of the company.
The company has high hopes put into the possibilities that come with Data Analysis, and they are especially hopeful that Data-Analyst's work can finally settle an ongoing debate: whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products.

*The Marketing Team Lead is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allow the company to grow.
*The main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the company’s recent quarterly results showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.
